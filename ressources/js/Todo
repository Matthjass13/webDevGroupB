- Implement Ennemy class
(ennemy moves in a line will be simpler I think)
  + the sprites are already in ressources folder, choose the ennemy you prefer !
  + manage collisions (losing a life when touching)
  Structure folder
- Implement Character selection
    For now, you can test both characters by changing the number argument when instanciating a pirate :
    new Pirate(x, y, 0) for original pirate and new Pirate(x, y, 1) for the new one.
    It would be great to have a way for the end user to choose the character without having him to change the code,
    there are a lot of options for that, how do you think we should do that ?
- Geolocalisation (for example in the menu page)
